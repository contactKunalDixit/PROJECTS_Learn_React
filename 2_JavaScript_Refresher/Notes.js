todo: Chapter 11 : Understanding "let" and "const"

* Earlier practice of using "var", for declaring variable has been replaced with "let" and "const"

* Use "let" if you'd want to declare a variable whose value can be changed later.
* Use "const" is you'd like to declare a variable and keep its value fixed, which is mostly the case in general.

todo: Chapter 12 : Arrow Functions

Imp Pointers:

*   You can omit the parameters brackets and shorten the syntax if there is only one arguement...but this may not work if there are more than one arguement.

* Also, if there is no code written above the return statement, we can also omit the curly braces, and the code can be shortened further 

let nameFunc = (name)=>{
    return name
}
can be written as 

let nameFunc = name => name

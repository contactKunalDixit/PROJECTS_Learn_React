Also before the return statement. calling it after return statement would make it redundant and wouldnt make any sense\n\t*\tReact hooks are functions\n\t*\tHooks can never be used within a nested function. like in  here, they cannot be used within 'filterChangeHandler'\n\t* \tuseState() doesnt just work by itself. it NEEDS an INITIAL value. Any changes to this value (any changes to this current STATE) will make the component function to be called again and thus we should define that initial value to that variable.\n\t*\tuseState() HOOK ALWAYS RETURNS an ARRAY comprising of EXACTLY 2 elements. The 1st element gives access to the VARIABLE VALUE ITSELF and the second is an FUNCTION which is used to change the value and trigger a re-EVALUATION of the component itself.\n\t* \tThe 1st element is just a pointer to that managed value (the current value which could be '' or initial value set by us, e.g '2020' as seen above) and the second element is the function named above as setFilteredYear which is used to change that initial value\n\t*\tThis function will do 2 things: 1st it will assign a new value (the arguemnt that is being passed) to the STATE aka the variable 'filteredYear' . 2nd, It'll also trigger REACT to re-EVALUATE the entire component again, thereby resetting all places where the state was being used, with the new value of the STATE. React will observe any changes it detects compared from the last time it evaluated this component and shows it on to the screen.\n\n\n\t* \tWhen to use hook - useState?\n   \n   \t*\tIf you have data which might change and where that change needs to be reflected to the UI, Then we need STATE because regular variables will not do  the trick however with STATE variable, you can use a function which NOT only change the initial value of the state but ALSO trigger a re-EVALUATION of the entire component. Even if there would be multiple components, this re-evaluation only happens for the component in which this STATE was registered, and no other. \n\t*/\n\n/*\n !\t2.\nThis function will do 2 things: 1st it will assign a new value(the arguemnt that is being passed) to the STATE aka the variable 'filteredYear'. 2nd, It'll also trigger REACT to re-EVALUATE the entire component again, thereby resetting all places where the state was being used, with the new value of the STATE\n\t\tReact will observe any changes it detects compared from the last time is evaluated this component and shows it on to the screen\n*  calling the setFilteredYear () MAY not change the value right away but rather SCHEDULES this STATE UPDATE to be executed and implemented post the re-EVALUATION cycle.\n*/\n\n/* \n\t !\t3\n\t *\tThe above function filters and gives a new array with the items that qualified for the condition passed in funtion form, as an argument.
